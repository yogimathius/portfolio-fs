      <p>I’d love to hear about what you’re working on and how I could help. I’m currently looking for a new role and am open to a wide range of opportunities. My preference would be to find a position in a company in London. But I’m also happy to hear about opportunites that don’t fit that description. I’m a hard-working and positive person who will always approach each task with a sense of purpose and attention to detail. Please do feel free to check out my online profiles below and get in touch using the form.</p>
